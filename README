	      Emacs Lisp Packages for Info documentation

This is a collection of recipes to build GNU Emacs packages wrapping
Info documentation.

There are various reasons why one needs such recipes:

1. When a computer host run the Debian GNU/Linux operating system,
   there are Info documentation files not distributed from the
   official repositories because of licence considerations (e.g. GNU
   Bash); Thus users of such host have to repeatedly search the web
   for that documentation and install it by hand.

2. Many Python based projects don't distribute Info documentation but
   they build their documentation with Sphinx which has a Texinfo
   builder (e.g. Django): One has to build and install that
   documentation by hand.

3. All documentation should be easily available to users: Do not rely
   on a system administrator to read documentation.

4. Local and integrated documentation is always better that online
   documentation.
